Reflection

This is a project for testing my skills and knowledge of react, redux and UI designs. I started this process by using the create-react-app boilerplate, then adding react-router-4.0 and redux.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 4.0, Redux, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
